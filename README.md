# discourse-anonymous-moderators

Allows moderators to have a second account for performing actions anonymously. Other staff members can see the real identity of the account.

**Note:** This feature relies on plus addressing for the child account e-mails, and requires `SiteSetting.normalize_emails` to be turned off.
